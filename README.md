### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.   -->

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- Find and use external api 
- Using Css, HTML, JAVASCRIPT 
- Using axios for the API
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to choose or search a cocktail
- Having a responsive design (grid and flexbox)

#### PostMVP  
<!-- *These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.* -->

- Add second API or propably I am going to have multiple API s
- Use local storage to save pictures and update and delete the pictures
- having a simple animation to make the website more Interactive 
- add some features like hovering over stuff 

## Priority Matrix

<!-- Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes -->

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day. Students usally put in around 40+ hours into their project 1.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.
